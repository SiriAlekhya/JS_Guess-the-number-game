# Number Guessing Game using JavaScript

# Overview
This project is a basic number guessing game where the user needs to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. The user has a limited number of attempts (score), and the highscore is tracked.

# How to Play
1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 20.
3. Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Check!" button.
4. Receive feedback on your guess and continue guessing until you get the correct number or run out of attempts.
5. Your current score and highscore will be displayed during the game.
6. Click the "Again!" button to start a new game.
